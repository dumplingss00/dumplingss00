## WHAT IS TIME MANAGEMENT?

Time Management refers to managing time effectively so that the right time is allocated to the right activity. time skills are important because they help you structure your work in a way that allows you to accomplish goals. For example, if your goal is to get a job, you need time to update your resume, search for openings, apply, research companies and prepare for interviews. Managing your time also allows you to have space to be creative and proactive with your goals. When you have a specific time set aside to complete your tasks, you can also allow for time to think about the big picture for yourself.

## WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE MOTIVATED?

When you are motivated, you will find it easy to stay focused over a period of time. When you are not motivated, you will not only find it difficult to stay focused, but you will find it difficult to get started in the first place.
